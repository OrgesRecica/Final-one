            <h1>How it was</h1>
            <p><b>The club was formed in 1900 when a number of football enthusiasts split from Münchner TurnVerein 1879 to escape the influence of the club's gymnasts, who did not hold a great enthusiasm for the new game, an attitude typical of the times in Germany. Almost from the start,
                 Bayern was a strong local side but failed to have much of an impact beyond that.
                For financial reasons, and to take advantage of better facilities held by other clubs, 
                they twice entered into mergers. In 1906, they negotiated a union with Münchner Sport Club. As part of the arrangement, the footballers 
                gave up black as one of their team colours and adopted the red and white of their new partners, which they wear to this day. Bayern won 
                their first title, as champions of the Bavarian league, in 1909 as a department of MSC. In 1919, shortly after World War I, Bayern left 
                MSC, whose 
                focus turned to field hockey and tennis, sports they are still active in today. Bayern then 
                joined forces with Turn- und Sportverein 1890 Jahn München until leaving that club in 1923, and have remained independent ever since.</b></p>
